    "Here you can adjust the *delitermer character* to be used for separating folder names and file names (default is `\"-\"`), the *pixel coordinates* for inserting the object, and other stuff.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### About Coordinates\n",
    "The top left pixel of the object is the coordinates origin in moviepy. For example, if the video has height of 1152px and the object has height of 260px, and you want to place the video at the bottom of the screen you can define `object_y_pos = 1152 - 260`, which would place the object at the very bottom of the screen. To add more padding between the object and the bottom screen subtract more pixels as the third term (e.g. `object_y_pos = 1152 - 260 - 65`). Note, you can either use integers or predefined strings. See the doc for further information:\n",

    "#### About Video Codec\n",
    "Codec to use for image encoding. Can be any codec supported by ffmpeg. If the filename is has extension ‚Äò.mp4‚Äô, ‚Äò.ogv‚Äô, ‚Äò.webm‚Äô, the codec will be set accordingly, but you can still set it if you don‚Äôt like the default. For other extensions, the output filename must be set accordingly.\n",

    "| `use_preset`             | Sets the time that FFMPEG will spend optimizing the compression (only affects mp4/H.264). Choices are: `ultrafast, superfast, veryfast, faster, fast, medium (default), slow, slower, veryslow`. Note that this does not impact the quality of the video, only the size of the video file.
